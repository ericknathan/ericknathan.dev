        . My time at the institution allowed me to delve deeper into the
        theoretical aspects of programming, algorithms, and data structures,
        which laid a strong foundation for my career. I also had the opportunity
        to collaborate on exciting projects, such as my final project called
        Grati, a feedback management platform that allows organizations to adopt
        a feedback culture.
