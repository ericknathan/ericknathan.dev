        theoretical aspects of programming, algorithms, and data structures,
        which laid a strong foundation for my career. I also had the opportunity
        to collaborate on exciting projects, such as my final project called
        Grati, a feedback management platform that allows organizations to adopt
        a feedback culture.

        In the second year of my degree, we developed GeniusXP, an innovative
        platform focused on revolutionizing events through the use of Artificial
        Intelligence and Deep Analytics. Created for the{" "}
        <Link href="https://plusoft.com/">Plusoft</Link> challenge, GeniusXP was
        designed to optimize every stage of an event, from preparation to
        post-event. This journey earned us a podium finish at FIAP NEXT 2024,
        crowning a year of significant learning, dedication, and growth in the
        practical application of technology to real-world experiences.
